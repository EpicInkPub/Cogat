# Data Capture Configuration Status

## ‚úÖ Current Setup

Your CogAT Test Prep application is now configured with **global, worldwide data capture** using the following architecture:

### 1. Primary Data Storage: Supabase Database ‚úÖ ACTIVE

**Status**: Fully configured and operational

**What's Captured**:
- Package order submissions (leads table)
- Bonus email signups (bonus_signups table)
- Analytics events (analytics_events table)

**Database Configuration**:
- URL: `https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co`
- All tables created with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Anonymous users can submit data (INSERT permission)
- Authenticated users can view analytics data (SELECT permission)

**Current Data**:
- 1 lead captured
- 0 bonus signups
- 196 analytics events tracked

**Global Access**: Yes - Supabase is a cloud-hosted database accessible worldwide

### 2. Fallback Data Storage: Google Sheets ‚è≥ NEEDS SETUP

**Status**: Integration code ready, waiting for your configuration

**Setup Required**:
1. Create a Google Sheet
2. Deploy the provided Google Apps Script
3. Add the Web App URL to your `.env` file

**Instructions**: See `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide

**What Happens**:
- If Supabase is unavailable, data automatically saves to Google Sheets
- Provides redundancy and backup
- You can access data in spreadsheet format for easy export

### 3. Last Resort: Browser localStorage

**Status**: Built-in, always active

**What Happens**:
- If both Supabase AND Google Sheets are unavailable
- Data is saved locally in the user's browser
- Can be exported via the Data Export page

## üåç Global Data Capture

Your data capture is **fully global and worldwide**:

‚úÖ **Supabase** - Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database
- Accessible from anywhere in the world
- Data persists permanently
- No geographic restrictions

‚úÖ **Google Sheets** (when you set it up)
- Cloud-hosted by Google
- Accessible globally
- Real-time updates

‚ùå **NOT localStorage** - This is only used as a last resort emergency fallback

When someone clicks "Order Now" and submits their information:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone Number
- Package Selected
- Grade Level

### Bonus Signup Form (`/bonuses`)
When someone enters their email for bonus materials:

   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL` (once configured)

2. **Build Process**: Run `npm run build` to create production bundle

3. **Testing**: Test all forms after deployment to ensure data capture works

4. **Monitoring**: Check the Analytics dashboard regularly to verify data is flowing

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All data transmission uses HTTPS
- Supabase uses Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Anonymous keys are safe to expose (limited permissions)
- No sensitive data is logged in browser console in production
- User data is never shared with third parties

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Set up Google Sheets** (recommended):
   - Follow `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md`
   - Provides backup redundancy
   - ~15 minutes to configure

2. **Test all forms**:
   - Submit test orders
   - Submit test signups
   - Verify data appears in Supabase

3. **Monitor analytics**:
   - Visit `/analytics` regularly
   - Track conversion rates
   - Identify popular packages

4. **Configure alerts** (optional):
   - Set up email notifications for new leads
   - Use Supabase webhooks or Google Sheets notifications

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Forms showing "Submission Failed"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify environment variables are loaded
- Test Supabase connection
- Check RLS policies allow anonymous inserts

### No data appearing in Analytics Dashboard
- Make sure you're logged in (if auth is enabled)
- Verify data exists in Supabase tables
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page

### Want to view all captured data
- Use the Data Export page: `/data-export`
